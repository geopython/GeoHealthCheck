Overview
--------

GeoHealthCheck is a Python application to support monitoring OGC services uptime
and availability.  It can be used to monitor overall health of networks
of resources.

Features
--------

- lightweight
- easy setup
- support for numerous OGC resources
- flexible and customizable: look and feel, scoring matrix
- user management
- database agnostic: any SQLAlchemy supported backend


Installation
------------

Quick and Dirty
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash


  virtualenv ghc && cd ghc
  . bin/activate
  git clone https://github.com/geopython/GeoHealthCheck.git
  cd GeoHealthCheck
  # install paver dependency for admin tool
  pip install Paver
  # setup app
  paver setup
  # create secret key to use for auth
  paver create_secret_key
  # almost there!  Customize config
  vi instance/config_site.py
  # edit:
  # - SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
  # - SECRET_KEY  # from paver create_secret_key
  # - GHC_RETENTION_DAYS
  # - GHC_RUN_FREQUENCY
  # - GHC_SELF_REGISTER
  # - GHC_NOTIFICATIONS
  # - GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_VERBOSITY
  # - GHC_ADMIN_EMAIL
  # - GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL
  # - GHC_SITE_TITLE
  # - GHC_SITE_URL
  # - GHC_SMTP  # if GHC_NOTIFICATIONS is enabled
  # - GHC_MAP  # or use default settings

  # init database
  python GeoHealthCheck/models.py create
  # start server
  python GeoHealthCheck/app.py  # http://localhost:8000/



Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoHealthCheck is built on the awesome Flask microframework and uses
Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interaction and Flask-Login for authorization.

OWSLib is used to interact with OGC Web Services.

Install
^^^^^^^

.. note::

  it is strongly recommended to install in a Python ``virtualenv``.
  a ``virtualenv`` is self-contained and provides the flexibility to install /
  tear down / whatever packages without affecting system wide packages or
  settings.

- Download GeoHealthCheck (releases can be found at
  https://github.com/geopython/GeoHealthCheck/releases)

Running
^^^^^^^

Start using the built-in ``mod_wsgi`` server:

.. code-block:: bash

  python GeoHealthCheck/app.py  # http://localhost:8000
  python GeoHealthCheck/app.py 0.0.0.0:8881  # http://localhost:8881
  python GeoHealthCheck/app.py 192.168.0.105:8957  # http://192.168.0.105:8957


To enable in Apache, use ``GeoHealthCheck.wsgi`` and configure in Apache
as per the main Flask documentation.

Core Concepts
-------------

GeoHealthCheck is built with the following concepts in mind:

- `Resource`: a single, unique endpoint, like an OGC WMS, FTP URL, or plain old
  web link.  A GeoHealthCheck deployment typically monitors numerous resources
- `Run`: the execution and scoring of a test against a `Resource`.  A
  `Resource` may have multiple `Runs`


Configuration
-------------

Core configuration is set by GeoHealthCheck in ``GeoHealthCheck/config_main.py``.
You can override these settings in ``instance/config_site.py``:

- **SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI**: the database configuration.  See the
  SQLAlchemy documentation for more info
- **SECRET_KEY**: secret key to set when enabling authentication.  Use
  the output of ``paver create_secret_key`` to set this value
- **GHC_RETENTION_DAYS**: the number of days to keep run history
- **GHC_RUN_FREQUENCY**: cron keyword used to indicate frequency of runs
  (i.e. ``hourly``, ``daily``, ``monthly``)
- **GHC_SELF_REGISTER**: allow registrations from users on the website
- **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS**: turn on email notifications
- **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_VERBOSITY**: receive additional email notifications than just ``Failing`` and ``Fixed`` (default ``True``)
- **GHC_WWW_LINK_EXCEPTION_CHECK**: turn on checking for OGC Exceptions in ``WWW:LINK`` Resource responses (default ``False``)
- **GHC_ADMIN_EMAIL**: email address of administrator / contact- notification emails will come from this address
- **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL**: list of email addresses that notifications should come to. Use a different address to **GHC_ADMIN_EMAIL** if you have trouble receiving notification emails
- **GHC_SITE_TITLE**: title used for installation / deployment
- **GHC_SITE_URL**: url of the installation / deployment
- **GHC_SMTP**:  configure SMTP settings if **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS** is enabled
- **GHC_RELIABILITY_MATRIX**: classification scheme for grading resource
- **GHC_MAP**: default map settings

  - **url**: URL of TileLayer
  - **centre_lat**: Centre latitude for homepage map
  - **centre_long**: Centre longitude for homepage map
  - **maxzoom**: maximum zoom level
  - **subdomains**: available subdomains to help with parallel requests

Enabling or disabling languages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the file ``GeoHealthCheck/app.py`` and look for the language switcher (e.g. 'en','fr') and remove or add the desired languages.
In case a new language (e.g. this needs a new translation file called ``*.po``)  is to be added,
make a copy of  one of the folders in ``GeoHealthCheck/translations/``; rename the folder to the desired language (e.g. 'de' for german);
start editing the file in ``LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`` and add your translations to the ''msgstr''.
Don't forget the change the specified language in the messages.po file as well.
For example the ``messages.po`` file for the german case has an english  ''msgid''  string,
which needs to be translated in ''msgstr'' as seen below.  ::

    -#: GeoHealthCheck/app.py:394
    -msgid "This site is not configured for self-registration"
    -msgstr "Diese Webseite unterst√ºtzt keine Selbstregistrierung"


Customizing the Score Matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GeoHealthCheck uses a simple matrix to provide an indication of overall health
and / or reliability of a resource.  This matrix drives the CSS which displays
a given resource's state with a colour.  The default matrix is defined as
follows:

.. csv-table::
  :header: low,high,score/colour

  0,49,red
  50,79,orange
  80,100,green

To adjust this matrix, edit **GHC_RELIABILITY_MATRIX** in
``instance/config_site.py``.

Administration
--------------

- create db

To create the database execute the following:

Open a command line, (if needed activate your virtualenv), and do ::

    python GeoHealthCheck/models.py create

- drop db

To delete the database execute the following, however you will loose all your information. So please ensure backup if needed:

Open a command line, (if needed activate your virtualenv), and do ::

    python GeoHealthCheck/models.py drop

Note: you need to create a Database again before you can start GHC again.


User Management
---------------

Adding Resources
----------------

When being logged in, click the Add+ button for adding new resources.

The folowing resource types are available:

- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Web Map Service (WMS)
- Web Address (URL)
- Catalogue Service (CSW)
- Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)
- Web Processing Service (WPS)
- Web Coverage Service (WCS)
- Web Feature Service (WFS)
- Tile Map Service (TMS)
- Web Accessible Folder (WAF)
- Sensor Observation Service (SOS)


Deleting Resources
------------------

Open the resource details by clicking its name in the resources list at the Dashboard page. Next to the resource title is a red Delete button.

Scheduling Runs
---------------

- Permanent Jobs

Edit the file ``jobs.cron`` that the paths reflect the path to the virtualenv.
Set the first argument to the desired monitoring time step. If finished editing,
copy the command line calls e.g. ``/YOURvirtualenv/bin_or_SCRIPTSonwindows/python /path/to/GeoHealthCheck/GeoHealthCheck/models.py run``
to the commandline to test if they work sucessfully.
On Windows - do not forget to include the ''.exe.'' file extension to the python executable.
For documentation how to create cron jobs see your operating system: on \*NIX systems e.g.  ``crontab -e`` and on
windows e.g. the `nssm <https://nssm.cc/>`_.

Build Documentation
-------------------

Open a command line, (if needed activate your virtualenv) and move into the directory  ``GeoHealthCheck/doc/``.
In there, type ''make html'' plus ENTER and the documentation should be build locally.
