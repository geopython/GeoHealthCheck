Configuration
=============

Core configuration is set by GeoHealthCheck in ``GeoHealthCheck/config_main.py``.
You can override these settings in ``instance/config_site.py``:

- **SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI**: the database configuration.  See the SQLAlchemy documentation for more info
- **SECRET_KEY**: secret key to set when enabling authentication. Use the output of ``paver create_secret_key`` to set this value
- **GHC_RETENTION_DAYS**: the number of days to keep run history
- **GHC_PROBE_HTTP_TIMEOUT_SECS**: stop waiting for the first byte of a probe response after the given number of seconds
- **GHC_MINIMAL_RUN_FREQUENCY_MINS**: minimal run frequency for Resource that can be set in web UI
- **GHC_SELF_REGISTER**: allow registrations from users on the website
- **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS**: turn on email notifications
- **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_VERBOSITY**: receive additional email notifications than just ``Failing`` and ``Fixed`` (default ``True``)
- **GHC_WWW_LINK_EXCEPTION_CHECK**: turn on checking for OGC Exceptions in ``WWW:LINK`` Resource responses (default ``False``)
- **GHC_ADMIN_EMAIL**: email address of administrator / contact- notification emails will come from this address
- **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL**: list of email addresses that notifications should come to. Use a different address to **GHC_ADMIN_EMAIL** if you have trouble receiving notification emails. Also, you can set separate notification emails to specific resources. Failing resource will send notification to emails from **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL** value and emails configured for that specific resource altogether.
- **GHC_SITE_TITLE**: title used for installation / deployment
- **GHC_SITE_URL**: url of the installation / deployment
- **GHC_SMTP**:  configure SMTP settings if **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS** is enabled
- **GHC_RELIABILITY_MATRIX**: classification scheme for grading resource
- **GHC_PLUGINS**: list of Core/built-in Plugin classes or modules available on installation
- **GHC_USER_PLUGINS**: list of Plugin classes or modules provided by user (you)
- **GHC_PROBE_DEFAULTS**: Default `Probe` class to assign on "add" per Resource-type
- **GHC_METADATA_CACHE_SECS**: metadata, "Capabilities Docs", cache expiry time, default 900 secs, -1 to disable
- **GHC_RUNNER_IN_WEBAPP**: should the GHC Runner Daemon be run in webapp (default: false)
- **GHC_LOG_LEVEL**: logging level: 10=DEBUG 20=INFO 30=WARN(ING) 40=ERROR 50=FATAL/CRITICAL (default: 30, WARNING)
- **GHC_MAP**: default map settings

  - **url**: URL of TileLayer
  - **centre_lat**: Centre latitude for homepage map
  - **centre_long**: Centre longitude for homepage map
  - **maxzoom**: maximum zoom level
  - **subdomains**: available subdomains to help with parallel requests

Enabling or disabling languages
-------------------------------

Open the file ``GeoHealthCheck/app.py`` and look for the language switcher (e.g. 'en','fr') and remove or add the desired languages.
In case a new language (e.g. this needs a new translation file called ``*.po``)  is to be added,
make a copy of  one of the folders in ``GeoHealthCheck/translations/``; rename the folder to the desired language (e.g. 'de' for german);
start editing the file in ``LC_MESSAGES/messages.po`` and add your translations to the ''msgstr''.
Don't forget the change the specified language in the messages.po file as well.
For example the ``messages.po`` file for the german case has an english  ''msgid''  string,
which needs to be translated in ''msgstr'' as seen below.  ::

    -#: GeoHealthCheck/app.py:394
    -msgid "This site is not configured for self-registration"
    -msgstr "Diese Webseite unterst√ºtzt keine Selbstregistrierung"


Customizing the Score Matrix
----------------------------

GeoHealthCheck uses a simple matrix to provide an indication of overall health
and / or reliability of a resource.  This matrix drives the CSS which displays
a given resource's state with a colour.  The default matrix is defined as
follows:

.. csv-table::
  :header: low,high,score/colour

  0,49,red
  50,79,orange
  80,100,green

To adjust this matrix, edit **GHC_RELIABILITY_MATRIX** in
``instance/config_site.py``.


Configuring notifications
-------------------------

GeoHealthCheck can send notifications to various channels, depending on resource.
Notifications can be configured in edit form:

.. figure:: _static/notifications_config.png
    :align: center
    :alt: GHC notifications configuration

    *Figure - GHC notifications configuration*


There are two channels implemented:

=====
Email
=====

Notifications can be send to designated emails. If set in config, GeoHealthCheck will 
send notifications for all resources to emails defined in **GHC_NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL**. 
Additionally, each resource can have arbitrary list of emails (filled in **Notify emails** 
field in edit form). By default, when resource is created, owner's email is added to 
the list. User can add any email address, even for users that are not registered in 
GeoHealthCheck instance. When editing emails list for a resource, user will get address 
suggestions based on emails added for other resources by that user. Multiple emails should
be separated with comma (`,`) char.

=======
Webhook
=======

Notifications can be also send as webhooks through `POST` request. Resource can have arbitrary 
number of webhooks configured. 

In edit form, user can add webhook configuration. Each webhook should be entered in separate field.
Each webhook should contain at least URL to which `POST` request will be send. GeoHealthCheck will 
send following fields with that request:

.. csv-table::
    :header: Form field,Field type,Description

    ghc.result,string,Descriptive result of failed test
    ghc.resource.url,URL,Resource's url
    ghc.resource.title,string,Resource's title
    ghc.resource.type,string,Resource's type name
    ghc.resource.view,URL,URL to resource data in GeoHealthCheck


Configuration can hold additional form payload that will be send along with GHC fields.
Syntax for configuration:

 * first line should be url to which webhook will be send
 * second line should be empty
 * third line (and subsequent) are used to store custom payload, and should contain either:
   * each pair of field and value in separate lines (`field=value`)
   * JSONified object, which properties will be used as form fields

Configuration samples:

* just an url

.. code::

    http://server/webhook/endpoint


* url with fields as field-value pairs

.. code::

    http://server/webhook/endpoint

    foo=bar
    otherfield=someothervalue


* url and payload as JSON:

.. code::

    http://server/webhook/endpoint

    {"foo":"bar","otherfield":"someothervalue"}
